Order Block is marked with a "dot" symbol on the chart above or below the corresponding candle/bar.
Order Block is indicated as a rectangle, which starts from the Order Block candle and is stretched to the beginning of the chart and beyond the current candle.

An Order Block (by default: "Red" for "Bearish" and "Green" for "Bullish") is exhibited if the following conditions are met:

- Liquidity Grab;
- Imbalance formation;
- No mitigation (price hasn't touched the Order Block yet).

Also, the indicator is plotting the FVG (Fair Value Gap) zone (SteelBlue by default). This function can be turned off in indicator settings.
