Order Block is marked with a "dot" symbol on the chart above or below the corresponding candle/bar.
Order Block is indicated as a rectangle, which starts from the Order Block candle and is stretched to the beginning of the chart and beyond the current candle.

An Order Block (by default: "Red" for "Bearish" and "Green" for "Bullish") is exhibited if the following conditions are met:

- Liquidity Grab;
- Imbalance formation;
- No mitigation (price hasn't touched the Order Block yet).
